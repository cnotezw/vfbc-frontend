The staff are incredibly friendly and attentive, and the food is simply delicious. But the best thing about Imbabala Lodge is the location. It's right on the Zambezi River, so you have stunning views of the river and surrounding bush from every tent. The game drives and boat safaris are unforgettable, and we were lucky enough to see elephants, lions, leopards, and rhinos. Imbabala Lodge is the perfect place to create memories that will last a lifetime.",

We went on a few game drives and saw all the big five animals, as well as a variety of other wildlife. The boat safaris were also great, and we got to see some amazing crocodiles and hippos. We would highly recommend Imbabala Lodge to anyone looking for a luxury African safari experience.",
